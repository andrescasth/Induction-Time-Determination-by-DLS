# Induction-Time-Determination-by-DLS
This Python script analyzes multiple Excel DLS datasets (time vs kcps). It calculates a baseline, defines a nucleation threshold (mean + three SD), and detects the induction time as the first â‰¥5 consecutive kcps above that limit. Results are compiled and exported to Excel.
